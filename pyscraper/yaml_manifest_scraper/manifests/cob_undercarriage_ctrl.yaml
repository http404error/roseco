description: cob_undercarriage_ctrl implements a controller for the omnidirectional
  base of Care-O-bot 3 on joint level. For a given Pltf-Twist the according wheel
  steering angles and linear wheel velocities are calculated based on the principle
  of rigid body motion. Each joint is than controlled individually to achieve the
  computed position and velocity
