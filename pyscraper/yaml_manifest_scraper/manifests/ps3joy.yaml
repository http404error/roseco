description: "Playstation 3 SIXAXIS or DUAL SHOCK 3 joystick driver.\n    Driver for\
  \ the Sony PlayStation 3 SIXAXIS or DUAL SHOCK 3\n    joysticks. In its current\
  \ state, this driver is not compatible\n    with the use of other Bluetooth HID\
  \ devices. The driver listens\n    for a connection on the HID ports, starts the\
  \ joystick\n    streaming data, and passes the data to the Linux uinput device\n\
  \    so that it shows up as a normal joystick."
