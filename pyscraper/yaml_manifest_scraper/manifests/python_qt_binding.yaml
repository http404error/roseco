description: "This stack provides Python bindings for Qt.\n    There are two providers:\
  \ pyside and pyqt.  PySide is released under\n    the LGPL.  PyQt is released under\
  \ the GPL.\n\n    Both the bindings and tools to build bindings are included from\
  \ each\n    available provider.  For PySide, it is called &quot;Shiboken&quot;.\
  \  For PyQt,\n    this is called &quot;SIP&quot;.\n\n    Also provided is adapter\
  \ code to make the user's Python code\n    independent of which binding provider\
  \ was actually used which makes\n    it very easy to switch between these."
