description: "<p>Packages in the denso suite provide controller functionality for\
  \ Denso's industrial manipulators. </p>\n   <p><a href=\"http://goo.gl/kL0vnf\"\
  >ORiN</a> (Open Robot interface for the Network) is a unified network interface\
  \ for industrial robot applications and has been stably utilized in Denso's manipulators\
  \ for years. Controllers in this package suite uses b-CAP, UDP-based control protocol\
  \ defined in ORiN. It also has mechanism to detect faulty commands. Using b-CAP,\
  \ ROS communicates to the embedded controller computer that has been achieving industry-proven\
  \ reliability. The computer also has mechanism to detect faulty commands. That said\
  \ as a whole the system maintains the same level of safeness with their commercial\
  \ product setting.</p>\n   <p>Also, as a genuine ROS package, it enables robot application\
  \ developers to access full ROS features. MoveIt! configuration package is also\
  \ included for some of Denso's robots.</p>\n   <p>Core functionality </p>"
