description: "hector_mapping is a SLAM approach that can be used without odometry\
  \ as well as on platforms that exhibit roll/pitch motion (of the sensor, the platform\
  \ or both).\n    It leverages the high update rate of modern LIDAR systems like\
  \ the Hokuyo UTM-30LX and provides 2D pose estimates at scan rate of the sensors\
  \ (40Hz for the UTM-30LX).\n    While the system does not provide explicit loop\
  \ closing ability, it is sufficiently accurate for many real world scenarios. The\
  \ system has successfully been used on\n    Unmanned Ground Robots, Unmanned Surface\
  \ Vehicles, Handheld Mapping Devices and logged data from quadrotor UAVs."
