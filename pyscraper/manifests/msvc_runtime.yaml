description: "Windows python scripts aren't recognised as executables, so alot of\
  \ the ros\n    build logic will fail when trying to call python scripts because\
  \ they \n    utilise the bash logic at the top of the script.\n     \n    This remedies\
  \ the problem by creating a batch script for each that calls\n    the relevant python\
  \ script.\n    \n    It also provides various other scripts, utilities, launchers\
  \ and dependency\n    targets for setting up the runtime."
