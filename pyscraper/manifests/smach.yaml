description: "SMACH is a task-level architecture for rapidly creating complex robot\n\
  \    behavior. At its core, SMACH is a ROS-independent Python library to build\n\
  \    hierarchical state machines. SMACH is a new library that takes advantage of\n\
  \    very old concepts in order to quickly create robust robot behavior with\n \
  \   maintainable and modular code."
