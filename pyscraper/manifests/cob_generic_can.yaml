description: The package cob_generic_can provides an interface for nodes on a can-bus
  and examplary wrappers for two PeakSys-can-libs. When a can-bus-device is generated
  (for an example see base_dirve_chain) you can use generic_can to create as many
  itfs as there will be components communicating via this can-bus. Assign type of
  the can communication device (e.g. usb-to-can or can-card of a specific vendor)
  and can-address of the target device. This package comes with wrappers for PeakSys
  and PeakSysUSB adapters.
