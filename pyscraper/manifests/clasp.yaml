description: "This ROS package contains the clasp answer set solver for\n    (extended)\
  \ normal logic programs developed at the University of\n    Potsdam.\n\n    Clasp\
  \ combines the high-level modeling capacities of answer set\n    programming (ASP)\
  \ with state-of-the-art techniques from the area\n    of Boolean constraint solving.\
  \ The primary clasp algorithm relies\n    on conflict-driven nogood learning, a\
  \ technique that proved very\n    successful for satisfiability checking (SAT).\
  \ Unlike other\n    learning ASP solvers, clasp does not rely on legacy software,\
  \ such\n    as a SAT solver or any other existing ASP solver. Rather, clasp\n  \
  \  has been genuinely developed for answer set solving based on\n    conflict-driven\
  \ nogood learning. clasp can be applied as an ASP\n    solver (on SMODELS format,\
  \ as output by Gringo), as a SAT solver\n    (on a simplified version of DIMACS/CNF\
  \ format), or as a PB solver\n    (on OPB format)."
