description: "\n        This package contains Player, from the Player Project\n  \
  \      (http://playerstage.sf.net). This package does not modify Player in any\n\
  \        way; it simply provides a convenient way to download and compile the\n\
  \        headers and libraries in a way that can be managed by the ROS dependency\n\
  \        system.\n    "
