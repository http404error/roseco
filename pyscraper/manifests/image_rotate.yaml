description: "<p>\n      Contains a node that rotates an image stream in a way that\
  \ minimizes\n      the angle between a vector in some arbitrary frame and a vector\
  \ in the\n      camera frame. The frame of the outgoing image is published by the\
  \ node.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This node is intended to allow camera images to\
  \ be visualized in an\n      orientation that is more intuitive than the hardware-constrained\n\
  \      orientation of the physical camera. This is particularly helpful, for\n \
  \     example, to show images from the PR2's forearm cameras with a\n      consistent\
  \ up direction, despite the fact that the forearms need to\n      rotate in arbitrary\
  \ ways during manipulation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It is not recommended to use\
  \ the output from this node for further\n      computation, as it interpolates the\
  \ source image, introduces black\n      borders, and does not output a camera_info.\n\
  \    </p>"
