description: "The v4r_ellipses package contains a computer vision library which is\
  \ able to detect ellipses within images.  \n    The package is able to estimate\
  \ the pose of the circle related to the ellipse the circle diameter as well as the\
  \ camera parameter are known.\n    A dynamic reconfigure interface allows the user\
  \ to tune the parameter of the system to ones needs.\n    But be aware that the\
  \ pose of a projected circle within a image (ellipse) has two solutions and only\
  \ one is published as TF.\n    A costom message (v4r_msgs) publishes all the data\
  \ as well as the pose ambiguity."
