description: "The speech_database package performs text-to-speech conversion by using\
  \ Google's speech synthesiser. \n\t  It also provides a storage solution for synthesised\
  \ speech.\n\t  Speech can be accessed by publishing a text string at the /speech\
  \ topic. If no entry exists, the text will by synthesised and stored locally in\
  \ an mp3 file. \n\t  After an entry that corresponds to the text was found or created,\
  \ a request to play the audio file is published at the /robotsound topic to be processed\
  \ by the soundplay_node.py of the sound_play package."
