description: "The v4r_artoolkitplus package is a wrapper around the ARToolKitPlus\
  \ software library for ROS.\n  The ARToolKitPlus is a extended version of ARToolKit's\
  \ library with a class-based API but with no VRML and camera library.\n  It is also\
  \ optimized to work with a set of precoded marker, so no marker training is needed.\n\
  \  The ARToolKitPlus library was published under GPL2, thanks for that work goes\
  \ to all people listed in a ./3rdParty/ARToolKitPlus/THANKS.\n  More details about\
  \ ARToolKitPlus package can be found under http://studierstube.org/handheld_ar/artoolkitplus.php"
