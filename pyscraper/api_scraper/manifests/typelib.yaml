description: "This library offers an introspection mechanism for C/C++ value-types.\
  \ I.e.\n      it offers a way to represent types, and to manipulate in-memory values\n\
  \      that are instances of those types.\n\n      A Ruby binding is included, which\
  \ gives a fast and transparent\n      modification of C/C++ in-memory types from\
  \ Ruby, and an associated\n      interface to call C functions from shared libraries."
