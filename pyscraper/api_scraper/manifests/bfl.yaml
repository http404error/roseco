description: "This package contains a recent version of the Bayesian Filtering\n \
  \ Library (BFL), distributed by the Orocos Project.  For stability\n  reasons, this\
  \ package is currently locked to revision 31655 (April\n  19, 2010), but this revision\
  \ will be updated on a regular basis to\n  the latest available BFL trunk.  This\
  \ ROS package does not modify\n  BFL in any way, it simply provides a convenient\
  \ way to download and\n  compile the library, because BFL is not available from\
  \ an OS package\n  manager.  This ROS package compiles BFL with the Boost library\
  \ for\n  matrix operations and random number generation."
