description: "Deprecated\n    &quot;cob_utilities&quot; subsumes a number of classes,\
  \ which are used in the original COb3 software. E.g. &quot;IniFile.h&quot; supports\
  \ the original inifile structure of Care-O-bot 3. &quot;MathSup.h&quot; provides\
  \ some basic functions like conversion from degree to radion or norming of angles\
  \ within +/- PI. The package is currently used while the drivers are ported to ROS\
  \ and Orocos respectively. Midterm it shall be removed and the ROS structures shall\
  \ be used for reading parameters during initialization. So, don't use this package\
  \ in new code!"
