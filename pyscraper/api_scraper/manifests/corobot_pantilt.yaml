description: "corobot_pantilt is actually the package logitech_pantilt from Dallas\
  \ Geocker that was just renamed and integrated in corobot stack for an easy installation\
  \ of the Corobot stack.\n     The script executing mjpg-streamer necessary for the\
  \ logitech_pantilt package has been integrated in this corobot_pantilt package.\
  \ Now you won't have to download mjpg-streamer and execute the script yourself,\
  \ only a make in the corobot_pantilt/src/mjpg-streamer/ folder is necessary."
