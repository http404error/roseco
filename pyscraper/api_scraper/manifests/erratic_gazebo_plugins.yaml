description: "\n        Contains a differential drive plugin that works with the erratic\
  \ robot model provided\n        in the erratic_description package. The plugin may\
  \ also work for other differential drive \n        robots. The purpose of this custom\
  \ plugin is to build the ROS functionality directly into a \n        proper Gazebo\
  \ plugin, rather than a node that communicates with Gazebo. \n    "
